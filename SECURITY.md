## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you have found a security vulnerability in Spring Boot please *DO NOT*
disclose it publicly until we've had a chance to fix it. Please don't report security
vulnerabilities using GitHub issues, instead head over to support@springdoc.org and
learn how to disclose them responsibly.
